DCH - TO DO
-----
- Groups and users should get a url-friendly unique username field
- Group/user links should link to path with username instead of the foo-bar placeholder
- Current field `user_name` is case sensitive, I think that should be just `name`, and unique username shoudl be called `username` (one word)
- Make sure these routes and their children get redirected when you don't have pernmissions: /groups /users /members


Questions / remarks
-------------------
- What is `sub` field in User record do? It's my email capitalized (Moenen.Erbuer@ibm.com), is that by design?
